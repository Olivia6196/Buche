   </p>
   <h2>Background</h2>
   <p>Growing up in a quiet town in Kogi State, my relationship with technology began in a very personal and creative way. We had a computer at home, not as a tool for technical exploration, but as a canvas for my imagination. My early years were spent typing out the stories I wrote, sketching houses and other things with digital paintbrushes and getting lost in the simple joy of games. The internet and the mechanics of websites were distant concepts; the
   computer was simply a portal for my creativity and a source of entertainment.<br>
      As I got older, I became more curious. I started to wonder how I could share the stories and drawings I made with
      other people. This made me look at the internet in a new way. My early lack of interest changed into a strong
      curiosity. I began to learn how websites are made, how information travels online, and how everything works
      together. This is how I went from just using a computer, to being passionate about building things in the digital
      world.
   </p>
   <h2>Education</h2>
   <p>I hold a degree in Human Anatomy, which at first seemed to have nothing to do with web development. Because of
      this, I was very afraid that I couldn't follow my interest in technology. I worried that without a strong tech
      background, web development would be too difficult and completely different from the human body I had studied for
      years.<br>
      However, everything changed on the very first day of my web development class. The tutor began by introducing the
      three core components of a website: HTML, which provides the basic structure; CSS, which handles the styling; and
      JavaScript, which controls the behavior. To my surprise, we used an analogy that immediately connected with me:
      the human body. The tutor explained that HTML is like the human skeleton, providing the fundamental structure or
      framework. CSS is like the external features of the body which includes; the skin, hair, and clothing, giving it
      its appearance. Finally, JavaScript is like the nervous system and brain, controlling the body's movements and
      interactions.<br>
      In that moment, web development made more sense for me. I realized that my background in anatomy had actually
      given me a unique way to understand this new field. My fear disappeared and I saw that my past experience wasn't a
      weakness at all, but an unexpected strength.
   </p>
   <h2>Experience</h2>
   <p> A recent achievement was my first web project, "Anatomy Explorer." I used my anatomy knowledge to build an
      interactive website where people could click on a skeleton to learn more. This project worked well, showed my
      skills and gave me the confidence to take on bigger challenges.<br>
      Also, for years, I used Microsoft Word for school and personal projects. This taught me how to organize
      information, which is important for building a website. I also used tools like Excel and SQL to analyze data on my
      own. This experience helped me learn to think logically and solve problems.
   </p>
   <h2>Skills</h2>
   <p>I have a basic understanding of web development, including HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which I grasped through a
      unique analogy. My experience with Excel and SQL has given me strong data analysis skills and a logical approach
      to problem-solving.<br> Furthermore, I am skilled at organizing information, which I learned from years of using Microsoft Word.These abilities provide a solid base for my work in tech.

   <h2>My favourite Tech Tools</h2>
   <p>
      my favourite tech tools are;
      <ol>
      <li>MySQL</li>
      <li>HTML and</li>
      <li>Excel</li>
      </ol>
   </p>
   <h2>Goals</h2>
   <p>My immediate goal is to become a highly skilled frontend developer, with a focus on building a fully interactive
      website that users can engage with. I am driven by the belief that true mastery comes from hands-on practice, and
      my goal is not only to build functional applications but to deeply understand the "why" behind every line of
      code.<br>
      My main goal is to become a full-stack developer by the end of my training. I want to become so good at my work
      that I can effectively teach new developers without needing to look at my notes. This will prove that my knowledge
      comes from real, hands-on practice, not just from books.
