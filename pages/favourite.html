    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For The dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour (500 g)</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>½ tsp salt</li>
        <li>250 g cold butter or margarine</li>
        <li>1 large egg (for dough)</li>
        <li>½ cup cold water</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk (for egg wash)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300 g minced beef (about ¾ lb)</li>
        <li>2 medium potatoes</li>
        <li>1 medium carrot </li>
        <li>1 medium onion </li>
        <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp curry powder</li>
        <li>½ tsp thyme</li>
        <li>1 seasoning cube </li>
        <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp flour (to thicken filling)</li>
        <li>½ cup water or beef stock</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol type="i">
       <li>Peel and dice the potatoes and carrots into very small cubes, finely chop the onions, and set them aside.</li>
       <li>Place a frying pan on medium heat, add two tablespoons of vegetable oil, and when it warms up, add the onions, stirring for about two minutes until they become soft and translucent.</li> 
       <li> Add the minced beef, break it apart with a spoon, and cook until it changes from pink to brown, then season with curry powder, thyme, seasoning cube, salt, and pepper, stirring well to combine.</li>
       <li>Pour in the diced potatoes and carrots, stir to mix, then add half a cup of water or beef stock, cover the pan, and cook until the vegetables are tender.</li>
       <li>Sprinkle two tablespoons of flour over the mixture, stir until the sauce thickens and holds together, then remove from the heat and let it cool completely.</li>
       <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt, add the cold butter in chunks, and rub it in with your fingertips until the mixture looks like fine breadcrumbs.</li>
       <li>Beat one egg, pour it into the flour mixture, and gradually add cold water a little at a time until a soft dough forms, stopping before it becomes sticky.</li>
       <li>Wrap the dough in cling film, place it in the fridge, and chill for 30 minutes.</li>
       <li>Lightly dust your work surface with flour, roll the dough out to about a quarter-inch thickness, and cut circles about 4 to 6 inches wide.</li>
       <li>Place one or two spoonsful of the cooled filling in the center of each circle, fold over into a half-moon shape, and press the edges with a fork to seal.</li>
       <li>Arrange the pies on a greased baking tray, brush the tops with beaten egg yolk, and bake in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
       <li>Remove from the oven, let them cool slightly, and serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
